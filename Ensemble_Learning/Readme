Will Write some basics about the ensemble learning and implement some of the basic to advanced versions of ensemble learning


----------------  -------------------   -------------------
Consider the case of Email-Spam...
If you want to detect some email as spam or not.You will have a bunch of rule.
But each rule doesnt have a good effect if you use it independently.So we need to find a way to combine 
all the individual rules which are effective.

So in Ensemble learner will have lot of learners(SVM,Desicion trees..etc) each will be runnning on the subset of data instead of overall data to
avoid the overfitting the data and finally combineing all the algorithm into a single one.

You may take the case of regression where you can take simple mean of all the output algorithms and give it as the final output.
